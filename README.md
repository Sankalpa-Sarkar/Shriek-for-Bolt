# Shriek-for-Bolt
A self-interest game built in Unity 3D and scripted in C#, Shriek For Bolt is a sprinting game wherein the user races against the AI character, dodging several obstacles with the objective of finishing first. The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding Reference. The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs the usage of an AI-controlled third person character who is set a target, and is raced to the target by a user-controlled third person character, dodging several obstacles to reach the finishing line first.
